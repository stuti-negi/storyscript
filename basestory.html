				<strong>The <u class="ANIMAL1">null</u> And The <u class="ANIMAL2">null</u> </strong>
			</h1>
			 <p>
			       A <strong><u class="ANIMAL1"> null</u></strong> was making fun of the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> one day for being so slow.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	   <strong><u class="result">"null"</u></strong> replied the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2"> null</u></strong>, " and I get there <strong><u class="REL_SP">null</u></strong>than you think. I"ll run you a race and prove it."
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	  The <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong> was much <strong ><u class="ADJE">null</u></strong> at the idea of running race with the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong>,but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <strong><u class="ANIMAL3">null</u></strong> who had concented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled <strong><u class="QTN">"null"</u></strong>.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	 The <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> feel very deeply now ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong>, he went off the course to practice <strong><u class="VB">null</u></strong> for <strong><u class="numb">2</u></strong> hours until the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> should catch up.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	  The <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily,and,after a time,passes the place where the <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong> was <strong><u class="VB">null</u></strong>. The <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong> was so caught up in <strong><u class="VB">null</u></strong>; and when at last he did stop, the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> was near the goal. The <strong><u class="ANIMAL1">null</u></strong> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <strong><u class="ANIMAL2">null</u></strong> in time.
